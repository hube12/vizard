This is a mod to show the structure generation process

3 superflat presets exits: 
- Stronghold
- Mineshaft
- Fortress


Current bugs are:

- Not saving to chunk when leaving area (save proto to worldchunks)
- Laggy client network (fix bitmask)
- Thread sync on disconnect is not ensured
- Mineshaft don't generate (fix soon)
- End cities template don't work, go in the end
