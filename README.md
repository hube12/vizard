This is a mod to show the structure generation process

5 superflat presets exits: 
- Stronghold
- Mineshaft
- Fortress
- End cities
- Bastion


Current bugs are:

- Not saving to chunk when leaving area (save proto to worldchunks) -> hard
- Village is not thread safe, fix it
- Structure_starts are not registered more than once
